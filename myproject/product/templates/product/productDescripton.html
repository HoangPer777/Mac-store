                    <h6>Breakthrough power from Apple M4 chip</h6>
                    <p>The MacBook Pro 14 2024 is powered by the new generation M4 chip, which can handle all tasks very
                        quickly and smoothly. Apple has upgraded the CPU performance both single-threaded and
                        multi-threaded, along with super-fast unified memory. Compared to the M1 chip version, the
                        MacBook Pro M4 is up to 3.4 times faster, making office tasks like Excel, Slack or web browsing
                        a breeze. In addition, the 24GB RAM capacity makes it easy to multitask between tasks without
                        interruption.</p>
